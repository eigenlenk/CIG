# Demo app
Decided to demake Windows 95 because of how relatively simple and boxy its GUI elements are. Obviously not going to mimic it all but it's a good testbed for developing and testing CIG features.

## What's there
* Start menu
* Basic window support with moving and resizing
* Dialog buttons and checkbox element
* Large file icon with text
* Window menubar

## What's not there
* Window minimzing, maximizing
* Moving around icons (not sure if needed - would be more about the demo architecture rather than CIG functionality)
* Task manager
* Scrollbars
* Large blocks of text

### Some notes
* üóíÔ∏è Scrollbars and larger blocks of texts could be developed and demo-d with a simple Notepad application I think
* ‚ÑπÔ∏è Start menu and window menubar would probably follow a similar structure
